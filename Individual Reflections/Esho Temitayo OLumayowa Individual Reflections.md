              **GROUP 15 SIMPLE INVENTORY SYSTEM**

							**ESHO TEMITAYO OLUMAYOWA REPORT**



As part of Group 15 that developed A Simple Inventory System, and also being the group leader, I’m proud of how our group came together to achieve our goals. Initially we faced challenges in coordinating everyone’s schedules and delegating tasks effectively. However, through regular meetings and open communication we were able to come together and work on the project.

I dedicated specific jobs to each members based on their strengths and what they were capable of, ensuring everyone had a clear understanding of their responsibilities. This approach boosted productivity but also fostered cohesiveness between the members of the group.
Scheduling regular meetings helped us stay on track and address any issues promptly. I made sure to listen to everyone’s inputs, suggestions and concerns, which encouraged collaboration and teamwork.

Through this project, I learned the importance of effective leadership, communication, and teamwork. Our efforts collectively paid off and we are proud of the simple inventory system that we have built, there may have been several challenges along the way but we were able to overcome it fully without any serious setbacks. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a dedicated and hardworking team. Through this, I learnt the importance of a group leader in a group
