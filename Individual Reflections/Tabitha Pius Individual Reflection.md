# Tabitha Pius Individual Reflection

Working on the Simple Inventory System project has been a truly enlightening experience for me. At the outset, I was both excited and a bit apprehensive, knowing that this project would challenge my understanding of Python and my ability to collaborate effectively with my peers. As we progressed, I found myself growing more comfortable with the codebase and the logic behind inventory management. The process of designing the system, from planning the features to implementing the GUI and handling data storage, taught me the importance of clear communication and teamwork.

One of the most valuable lessons I learned was the significance of breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks. Whenever we encountered a bug or a design challenge, our group would brainstorm solutions together, and I realized how much I could learn from the perspectives of others. I also appreciated the opportunity to contribute my ideas and see them come to life in the final product.

Beyond the technical skills, this project helped me develop patience and resilience. There were moments when things didnâ€™t work as expected, and it was tempting to feel frustrated. However, by persevering and seeking help when needed, I was able to overcome these obstacles and grow as a programmer.

Overall, I am proud of what we accomplished and grateful for the chance to work with such a supportive team. This experience has inspired me to continue learning and to approach future projects with confidence and curiosity.
