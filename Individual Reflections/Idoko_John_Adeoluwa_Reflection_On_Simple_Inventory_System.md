# Reflection on Simple Inventory System

My name is Idoko John Adeoluwa, and I am pleased to share my experience working on the Simple Inventory System project. This project was a great opportunity for me to learn how Python can be used to solve practical problems in business and everyday life. By working with CSV files, I learned how to store, update, and manage inventory data efficiently. The use of a graphical user interface made the system user friendly and helped me understand how to connect backend logic with frontend design.

Throughout the project, I improved my skills in organizing code into modules, which made the program easier to maintain and understand. I also learned the importance of teamwork, as we collaborated to solve challenges and share ideas. Each member contributed unique strengths, and together we built a functional system that can help businesses keep track of their stock.

I am proud of the progress I made and the new skills I gained, such as handling file operations, designing interfaces, and working with Python libraries. This experience has motivated me to continue learning and applying programming to real-world problems. I am grateful for the support from my team and look forward to more opportunities to grow as a developer.
