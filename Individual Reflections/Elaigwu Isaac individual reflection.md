PROJECT REFLECTION ON SIMPLE INVENTORY SYSTEM
The “Simple Inventory System” project was a practical way to apply Python skills. The aim was to build a program to manage stock by adding items, updating quantities, and displaying inventory clearly. 

It strengthened my grasp of Python basics like variables, lists, dictionaries, and control structures. Creating functions helped me write reusable code, while handling user inputs and error checks improved my skills with conditionals and loops. I learned the importance of data validation for accuracy.

A key lesson was modular design using smaller functions made debugging and expanding easier. In the future, the system could include file storage or a basic graphical interface.

Overall, the project showed how Python solves real world business problems. It enhanced my problem solving skills and confidence in writing clean, organized code, setting a solid foundation for more advanced projects.
