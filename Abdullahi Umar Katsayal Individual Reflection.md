								**GROUP 15 SIMPLE INVENTORY SYSTEM**

								**ABDULLAHI UMAR KATSAYAL REPORT**



Our project is an application designed to help small businesses manage their product inventory. I learnt and deepened my knowledge of python, pipenv, object oriented programming, various libraries and most especially github and how to use and navigate it, it is truly a milestone in my engineering journey. 

The project is primarily focused on backend development and UI/UX design. In the backend we focused on creating the Inventory and Product classes, which formed the core data model. This involved implementing key functionalities such as adding, deleting, and adjusting product stock, as well as handling file operations for importing and exporting data. We however were unsuccessful in integrating undo/redo functionality, it required a deep understanding of state management and data persistence using a history stack but it kept misbehaving so unfortunately we had to remove it for our final version.

For the frontend, we used CustomtKinter as its more modern than tKinter, this is where mainly we used our OOP classes and event-driven programming. Handling user inputs, managing dialog boxes, and refreshing the UI based on changes to the backend state were particularly valuable learning experiences. 

I also learnt the importance of structured programming and modular design. By separating the data logic (inventory.py) from the user interface (gui.py), the codebase became much easier to manage, debug, and extend. This shows that a well organized, thoughtful, broken down to simple and easy steps is always the best approach to good software architecture and is crucial for building robust and scalable applications.
